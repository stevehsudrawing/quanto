# What and how to translate

There are files you need to translate or localize:

- [`.\@Resources\Language\en-us.inc`](https://github.com/SteveHsuDrawing/quanto/blob/main/%40Resources/Language/en-us.inc)
- [`.\@Resources\Language\GetStarted\en-us.inc`](https://github.com/SteveHsuDrawing/quanto/blob/main/%40Resources/Language/GetStarted/en-us.inc)
- [`.\@Resources\Language\Shortcuts\en-us.inc`](https://github.com/SteveHsuDrawing/quanto/blob/main/%40Resources/Language/Shortcuts/en-us.inc)

You can duplicate these files and rename them as a code in [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) and [ISO 3166-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2) format, such as `en-us` represents `English (United States)` and `fr-fr` represents `Français (France)`.

You can edit these with any text editor. Please save your files with `UTF-16 LE` or `UTF-16 LE with BOM` encoding to avoid garbled characters.

When you need to **test your translation**, please modify `Language` Key Value in `Fluent_Design\@Resources\Settings.inc` as the code of the language what you're translating, then refresh all skins.

## Description of language files

Every key has a name and a value, delimited by an equals sign (=), and the name appears to the left of it. When translating, please **modify the key value, not its name**.

### About key names

|Key names starting with|Represent as|
|-|-|
|`T.`|Terms|
|`S.`|Sentences|
|`P.` or `Default.`|Default Values|
|Other keywords in language file|Terms or sentences|

### About key values

`#CRLF#` or `[#CRLF]` means "wrap the text to the next line".

There are **something you shouldn't translate**, such as names of variable keys (nouns enclosed in brackets（[]) or Tic Tac Letters(#)) and "%x".
